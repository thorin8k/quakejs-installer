Put all your maps here. One pk3 file for each map. The maps will be added to the server.cfg mapcycle. If you have additional resources (e.g. music in a separate pk3) you have to decide whether you want to add that pk3-file to pak100 / pak101 or if you merge the content of the additional pk3 with the maps file so you have just one pk3 (the latter is the preferred way if the additional assets are only needed to play a single map).
